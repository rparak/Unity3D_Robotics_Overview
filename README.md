# Unity3D Industrial Robotics: An Overview

## ABB IRB 120

The project is focused on a simple demonstration of client / server communication via RWS (Robot Web Services), which is implemented in Unity3D. The project demonstrates the Digital-Twin of the ABB IRB 120 robot with some additional functions. The application uses performance optimization using multi-threaded programming.

This solution can be used to monitor a real robot or to simulate it (ABB RobotStudio in Windows). The Unity3D Digital-Twin application was tested on the IRB120 robot, both on real hardware and on simulation.

The application can be installed on a mobile phone, tablet or computer, but for communication with the robot it is necessary to be in the same network.

## Universal Robots UR3

The project is focused on a simple demonstration of client / server communication via TCP / IP, which is implemented in Unity3D. The project demonstrates the Digital-Twin of the UR3 robot with some additional functions. The application uses performance optimization using multi-threaded programming.

This solution can be used to control a real robot or to simulate it (using VMware - UR Polyscope in Windows), E and CB series. The Unity3D Digital-Twin application was tested on the UR3 robot, both on real hardware and on simulation.

The application can be installed on a mobile phone, tablet or computer, but for communication with the robot it is necessary to be in the same network.

## Sorting Machine (B&R Automation, SMC)

The project is focused on a simple demonstration of client / server communication via OPC UA, which is implemented in Unity3D (Server - B&R Automation PLC, Client - Unity3D). The project demonstrates the Digital-Twin of the Sorting Machine with some additional functions. The application uses performance optimization using multi-threaded programming.

This solution can be used to control a real machine or to simulate it (Automation Studio Runtime Simulation/ Real PLC). The Unity3D Digital-Twin application was tested on the simulation using X20CP1584 PLC. It is possible to use another OPC UA server, but in accordance with certain principles (Input / Output nodes).

The application can be installed on a mobile phone, tablet or computer, but for communication with the machine it is necessary to be in the same network.

## B&R Automation ACOPOStrak transport system

The project is focused on a simple demonstration of client / server communication via OPC UA, which is implemented in Unity3D (Server - B&R Automation PLC, Client - Unity3D). The project demonstrates the Digital-Twin of the ACOPOStrak with some additional functions. The application uses performance optimization using multi-threaded programming.

The main idea of the application is to demonstrate the control of an amazing machine that can be used for adaptive production. For visual inspection of the object, we use a B&R 2D camera/sensor with additional light and the entire control program (velocity and / or position control of shuttles (min 1 - max 6) around multiple sectors (A, B), alarm handling, and others) is programmed on the PLC (OPC UA Server).

The application can be installed on a mobile phone, tablet or computer, but for communication with the machine it is necessary to be in the same network.

## Simple Linear Axis (B&R Automation, SMC)

The project is focused on a simple demonstration of client / server communication via OPC UA, which is implemented in Unity3D (Server - B&R Automation PLC, Client - Unity3D). The project demonstrates simple motion control using Mapp Technology and PLCOpen. The application uses performance optimization using multi-threaded programming.

This solution can be used to control a real axis or to simulate it (Automation Studio Runtime Simulation/ Real PLC). The Unity3D Digital-Twin application was tested on both simulation and real PLC (X20CP1584). It is possible to use another OPC UA server, but in accordance with certain principles.

The application can be installed on a mobile phone, tablet or computer, but for communication with the machine it is necessary to be in the same network.
